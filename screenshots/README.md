# Screenshots

Add your working UI snapshots here so reviewers can see the app without running it. Use these exact names so the main README links work:

- `login.png` – Login page with credential validation
- `users-list.png` – Users table with Add / Edit / Delete
- `data-entry.png` – Add/Edit user form (Name, DOB, Address, Phone)

Then commit and push. The main README will display them in the table.
